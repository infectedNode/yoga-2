It was a wish from heart to learn that knowledge, and even it was a short course (50hours), but all the knowledge was teached to me what is important to know, in theory and practical lessons. The teachers are very nice and they teach from heart. Also they are nice in person and take care of you, if you feel comfortable with everything. The room is very nice and all the Ashram, with Ganga view and nice people and good indian food. I am very thankful for my experience and I will always come back for drop in class or any course.</strong></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Experiencing the All-round Benefits of the Sun Salutation Yoga Pose (Surya Namaskar)</strong><br />
Surya Namaskar is a series of twelve physical postures. These alternating backward and forward bending postures flex and stretch the spinal column through their maximum range giving a profound stretch to the whole body.<br />
Often, after a hard day work, we would just flop down on the couch apparently relaxing our bodies &#8211; but it is not so. The stagnant energies remain locked up and the organs remain de-oxygenated to a large extent. Surya Namaskar has a deep effect in detoxifying the organs through copious oxygenation and has a deeper relaxing effect.<br />
To list some of the benefits of Suryanamaskar:<br />
1. Tones up the digestive system by the alternate stretching and compression of abdominal organs. It activates digestion and gets rid of constipation and dyspepsia.<br />
2. Strengthens abdominal muscles.<br />
3. Thoroughly ventilates the lungs, and oxygenates the blood.<br />
4. Acts as detoxifying agent, by getting rid of enormous quantity of carbon dioxide and other toxic gases.<br />
5. Promotes sleep and calms anxiety.<br />
6. Tones up the nervous system and improves memory.<br />
7. Normalizes the activity of the endocrine glands &#8211; especially the thyroid gland.<br />
8. Refreshes the skin. Prevents Skin disorders.<br />
9. Improves muscle flexibility.<br />
10. In women, restores any lost elasticity, through stimulation of glands and the strengthening of pectoral muscles.<br />
11. Menstrual irregularity and assists in easy childbirth.<br />
12. Prevents loss of hair and graying.<br />
13. Helps reduce fat.<br />
14. Eliminates unpleasant smells from the body.<br />
15. Lends grace and ease of movements to the body.<br />
16. Revives and maintains the spirit of youthfulness.<br />
17. Broadens chest and beautifies arms.<br />
18. Makes the spine and waist flexible.<br />
19. Produces health, strength, efficiency and longevity.<br />
Who should NOT do Surya Namaskar?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">• Pregnant women should not practice this after third month of pregnancy.<br />
• Patients of Hernia and high blood pressure are warned against this practice.<br />
• People suffering from back conditions should seek proper advice before commencing Surya Namaskar.<br />
• Women should avoid Surya Namaskar during menses.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">How to do?<br />
As mentioned Surya Namaskar is a flowing series of 12 yoga postures. Before each round we chant the name of Sun. Total names of Sun are 12. These are described below:<br />
1. Om Mitraye Namah &#8211; &#8211; Friend Of All<br />
2. Om Ravaye Namah – &#8211; Praised By All<br />
3. Om Suryaya Namah – &#8211; Guide Of All<br />
4. Om Bhanave Namah – &#8211; Bestower Of Beauty<br />
5. Om Khagaye Namah – &#8211; Stimulator Of Senses<br />
6. Om Pushne Namah – &#8211; Nourisher Of All<br />
7. Om Hiranyagarbhaya Namah – &#8211; The Creator<br />
8. Om Marichaye Namah – &#8211; Destroyer Of Disease<br />
9. Om Adityay Namah – &#8211; The Inspirer<br />
10. Om Savitre Namah – &#8211; The Purifier<br />
11. Om Arkaya Namah – &#8211; The Radiant<br />
12. Om Bhaskaraya Namah – &#8211; The Illuminator<br />
Note: Always End Up Surya Namaskar By With “Om ShriSavitr Surya NarayanayeNamah.”<br />
Synchronizing the breath with the movements of the body is very important. The basic breathing principle is to inhale whenever body is in pain and exhale whenever body relaxes.<br />
The Twelve Postures:<br />
Pranamasana (Salutation posture): Start from Here Always.<br />
Stand erect with feet together. Join the palms together in front of the chest. Concentrate on standing straight, steady and in a prayerful attitude. This posture helps to induce a state of introversion, relaxation and calmness. It activates the anahata chakra. Exhale fully.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">1. Urdhav asana/Hastauttanasana (Raised arm posture)<br />
Inhaling stretch both arms above the head, palms facing upward. Arch the back and stretch the whole body. This posture stretches the chest and the abdomen and lifts the Prana (energy) upward to the upper parts of the body propelled by inhalation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. Padahastasana (Hand to foot posture)<br />
Exhaling bend the body forward and down, keeping the spine straight. Avoid collapsing the chest or &#8220;over-rounding&#8221; the upper back. Keep the legs straight and perpendicular to the ground. The knees may be allowed to bend a little if needed. This posture massages the abdominal organs, especially the liver, kidneys, pancreas, adrenals, uterus and ovaries. The power of digestion increases and female disorders such as prolapsed and menstrual irregularities are relieved. A healthy flow of blood is sent to the spinal nerves as they are stretched and toned. The hamstring muscles at the back of the thigh and calf muscles are stretched and toned. Inversion increases blood flow to the brain. The Prana is channeled to the lower regions of the body propelled by exhalation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. EkPadhaPrasarnasana (Equestrian posture)<br />
On your next inhalation, extend the left leg back and drop the knee to the ground. The right knee is bent and kept between the hands and the right foot placed flat on the ground. Lift the spine and open the chest. Concentrate at the eyebrow center.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4.Dwi Pada Prasarnasana (Stick Pose)<br />
On the exhalation bring the right leg back to join with the left leg. Bring your whole body parallel to ground. This posture strengthens the nerves and muscles in the arms and legs, stretches the calf muscles and makes the spine straight and taut. It relieves varicose veins and tones spinal nerves. Maintaining the posture take a deep inhalation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">5. SashankAsana(Hare Pose)<br />
Exhaling come to this position. Good asana for relaxing the whole body. Maintaining the posture take a deep inhalation. Maintaining the posture take a deep inhalation.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">6. AshtangaNamaskara/ SashtangaPranipat Asana (Salutation with eight limbs)<br />
Exhaling gently drop both knees to the ground and slowly slide the body down at an angle as you bring the chest and chin to the ground. All eight limbs &#8211; toes, knees, chest, hands and chin &#8211; touch the floor. The buttocks are kept up. Hold the breath. This posture develops the chest and strengthens arms. It sends additional blood to this area helping to rejuvenate the nerves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">7. Bhujangasana (Cobra posture)<br />
On the inhalation, lower the hips while pushing the chest forward and upward with the hands, until the spine is fully arched and the head is facing up. The knees and lower abdomen remain above the floor. Focus the awareness at the base of spine and feel the tension from the forward pull. This pose gives dynamic expansion to the organs of the chest and abdomen, relieving many ailments such as asthma, constipation, indigestion, kidney and liver problems. It is very helpful in relieving tension in the back muscles and spinal nerves.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">8. Parvatasana/ AdhoMukhSvanAsana (Mountain posture)<br />
Exhale and upward your hip, legs are straight and the head is facing inside.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">9. AshwaSanchalanasana/ EkPadhPrasarnAsana (Equestrian posture)<br />
Inhale and swing the right leg forward between the hands. The left leg remains back. Resume posture 3.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">10. Padahastasana (Hand to foot posture)<br />
Exhaling, bring the left foot forward. Join both legs and resume posture 2.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">11. Hastauttanasana/Urdhavasana (Raised arm posture)<br />
Inhale, raise the trunk up and bend backward. Resume posture 1.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">12. Pranamasana (Salutation posture)<br />
Exhale Straighten the body and bring the hands in front of the chest.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">Note:The above constitutes one half of a round of Surya Namaskara. To complete the other half the same movements are repeated except that the right leg is brought back in posture 3 and the left foot is brought forward in posture 9. So one full round consists of the exercises done twice. Practice up to 6 rounds in the morning and 6 rounds in the evening.<br />
When the exercises are done a little quickly, the gain is more physical while if they are done slowly with breath awareness the gain is more mental and spiritual.If for any reason, the above directions seem confusing, it is best to see the Surya Namaskar in visual flow. It will help you do the practice correctly without the risk of doing harm to your body. Incorporate the Surya Namaskar into your daily routine and make a positive difference to your life.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>PRAAN YOG (The Science of Life Energy flow and Nerves)</strong><br />
The concept of<strong> Praan</strong> is not so well known, primarily because it is not a physically verifiable organ in the body. The word<strong> Praanaayaam</strong> is widely known but is generally understood to be the breathing process, that of inhaling and exhaling air, as it is seen and experienced by everyone and easily understood in the gross. But the<strong> Praan</strong> or life energy automatically flows in the body with every breath. Being a subtle energy flow, it is formless, cannot be seen or physically experienced but its understanding is possible by observing certain definitive responses that result from manipulating the flow of<strong> Praan</strong> in the body. <strong>Praan</strong> is also called<strong> Vaayu</strong>, for it is not static but moving, it enlivens the body and enables it to perform different functions. Accordingly, it is divided into five <strong>Praans,</strong> viz<strong>. Paan, Apaan, Byaan, Udaan and Samaan</strong>, and five sub-Praans, viz.<strong> Naag, Koorma, Krikar, Devadatta and Dhanajaya</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>The<strong> Paan Vaayu</strong> resides in the heart, the seat of<strong> Anaahat Chakra</strong>, and functions from the mouth and nostrils down up to the stomach. It is responsible for the working of all the organs in this area but its primary role is in the smooth running of the respiratory and digestion processes. The <strong>Apaan Vaayu</strong> resides at the<strong> Moolaadhaar Chakra</strong> and operates in the lower parts of body, downwards up to the feet. It can be felt from the energy required for its main functions, viz. the release of the urine and excreta from the body, ejaculation of semen in males and pushing the fetus out at the time of childbirth in females. <strong>Samaan Vaayu</strong> resides in the navel, the <strong>Manipur Chakra,</strong> and operates between the heart and navel region. It is responsible for proper assimilation of the nutrients (extracted from food) in the blood stream and its distribution to all parts of the body through the blood circulation. <strong>Byaan Vaay</strong>u resides in the region between the navel and the sex organ, the position of <strong>Swaadhisthaan Chakra,</strong> and is responsible for communications all over the body through the network of nerves.<strong> Udaan Vaayu</strong> resides at the dip on the throat, the <strong>Vishuddha Chakra,</strong> and is responsible for activity of the organs situated upwards up to the crown. It provides the ability to the body to stand and is also the vehicle for the transmutation of the Soul, at the time of death, to the next destination. The Soul, along with the <strong>Chittavrittis and Karmaphals</strong> (all such memories of the individual that were very dear to him, he was attached to them, which have left their<strong> Samskaars on the Chitta</strong>, as also the cumulative returns of his actions throughout life) at the time of death, rides with the Udaan Vaayu to its next birth. The time the Soul spends in transmutation from one life to the next is called the<strong> Preta-yoni.</strong></p>
<p>The concept of <strong>Praan</strong> can be explained convincingly by a simple example. <strong>Praan</strong> is independent of the <strong>Aatman i</strong>n the sense that until the Praan enters the body, the Aatman alone cannot activate the body. We all accept that God is all-pervasive, residing in both living and nonliving matter. But it is the<strong> Praan</strong> that starts activity in the body with Aatman’s impulse. In other words, Praan alone also cannot start activity in the body in the absence of the directions from<strong> Jivaatmaa</strong>. The best way to understand this complex situation is to think of the body as the car, the <strong>Jivaatmaa</strong> as the driver and Praan as the electricity provided by the battery by the turn of the car key. We may also consider the example of the clay pot. The potter cannot handle the clay without water. We can say that water is like <strong>Praan</strong> for helping the potter work with the clay.</p>
<p>The naadis are not the usual nerves that medical science is aware of but relate to airspaces within them through which the Praan moves. In fact, Naadyog is also a well-developed science that deals with sound energy flow. Naad means sound and Naadi is the sound-tube through which it travels. Praan is thus also treated as a form of sound energy. The chanting of the Pranava mantra or the cosmic sound ‘Om’ has to be seen as the flow of Praan all over the body. It is common experience that chanting the Om sound in unison in a congregation immediately creates an atmosphere of cosmic vibrations in which the flow of Praan in the body settles down almost instantly and those present there enjoy a state of total relaxation. Some may even immerse in a sense of bliss. The other point to make special note is of the special role music plays in our lives. Listening to music is also nothing but a healing therapy. It allows the sound energy to carry out the involuntary healing process about which we may be unaware but it nevertheless takes place automatically and that is why people feel so relaxed if music of their choice is playing. Alternately when they wish to calm down their anxiety or simply relax, they turn on the music of their choice. The three main naadis are Sushumna,Ida and Pingalaa&#8230;..</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yogic Diet &#8211; Wholesome and Vegetarian</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>“susnigdhamadhuraharascaturthamsavivarjitah |</em></strong><br />
<strong><em> Bhujyate sivasamprityai mitaharah sa ucyate||”…(Hatha Yog Pradipika)</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is said that ,” Eating sweet, unctuous food offered to the Almighty leaving one-quarter of stomach empty is Mitahara.”<br />
To really understand Yoga&#8217;s approach to diet you must familiarize yourself with its effect on the mind and body:<br />
I. Sattvic foods are pure and health promoting, (sattva-quality of love, light and life)<br />
II. Rajastic foods are stimulating (Rajas-quality of activity and passion, lacking stability)<br />
III. Tamastic foods are impure (Tamas-the quality of darkness and inertia, dragging us into ignorance and attachment).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I. Sattvic Food:</strong><br />
The yogic-diet is lacto-vegetarian, which means that it is made up entirely of non-animal foods. Evidence suggests that a predominantly vegetarian diet is good for our health. Yogic diet consists of pure, simple, natural foods that are easily digested and promote health. Simple meals help easier and faster digestion and assimilation of foods. The premise is that, such a diet being healthy, it will help develop a stronger body and a calmer, more peaceful state of mind with a balanced flow of energy between them.<br />
Sattvic diet is the most suitable one for any serious student of Yoga. More importantly, as a Yogic diet has a very high nutritional value, the food is also rich in Prana or vital energy. When you feel the upsurge of life force as a result of this diet, you will understand why the sages said, &#8220;You are what you eat.&#8221;Food should be organically grown if possible, and free of preservatives and additives.<br />
Saltvic foods include: cereals and whole meal bread, fresh fruit and vegetables, dairy products, nuts, seeds and grains, sprouted seeds, dried peas, lentils and beans, honey, pure natural fruit juices, herbal tea, pure water etc…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>II. Rajastic Food:</strong><br />
Rajastic foods make people physically more active, but over the long term too many Rajastic foods may over stimulate the body, excite the passions and make the mind restless. Rajastic foods feed the body at the expense of the mind; they destroy the mind-body equilibrium. Rajastic foods are stimulating; very hot, spicy, dry, salty, stale etc. Even eating in a hurry is considered Rajastic.<br />
Rajastic foods include: non- vegetarian food like fish, meet etc.., eggs, hot substances, such as sharp spices or strong herbs, stimulants such as coffee, teas and cola drinks, too much salt, chocolate, onion and garlic, cayenne peppers, turmeric, curry powder etc…</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>III. Tamastic Food</strong><br />
Tamastic diet benefits neither the mind nor the body. Prana is withdrawn, powers of reasoning become clouded and a sense of inertia sets in. The body&#8217;s resistance to disease is destroyed and the mind is filled with dark emotions, such as anger and greed. Tamastic foods are bad smelly, left-over, stored, spoiled, burnt, tasteless or impure etc&#8230; Foods that are factory farmed or highly processed would be considered tamastic. Overeating is also considered Tamastic.<br />
Tamastic foods include: alcohol and tobacco, fermented foods such as vinegar, stale overripe substances, processed food, canned and packaged food, junk food, pickled and salted foods, stored non-vegetarian food like chicken, fish, mutton etc&#8230;.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>*AC का सही उपयोग<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f44d.png" alt="👍" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" />* जैसा कि सभी को पता है कि भीषण गर्मी शुरू हो चुकी है और घर घर एयर कंडीशनर चलने लगे हैं।</p>
<p>अधिकतर लोगों की आदत है कि वह अपने AC को 20-22 डिग्री पर चलाते हैं और ठंड लगने पर दोहर व कंबल आदि ओढ़ लेते हैं। इससे दोहरा नुकसान होता है। आईये जानते हैं कैसे:</p>
<p>क्या आपको पता है कि हमारे शरीर का तापमान 35 डिग्री सेल्शियस होता है। शरीर 22 डिग्री से 39 डिग्री तक का तापमान सह सकता है। इसे कहते हैं human body temperature tolerance.</p>
<p>तापमान के इससे कम या अधिक होने पर शरीर प्रतिक्रिया करने लगता है जैसे छीकें आदि।</p>
<p>जब आप 20-21 डिग्री पर AC चलाते हैं तो यह तापमान शरीर के सामान्य तापमान से कम है और इससे शरीर में hypothermia नाम का एक process शुरू हो जाता है जो रक्त प्रवाह (blood circulation) को प्रभावित करता है और शरीर के कुछ अंगों में रक्त ठीक प्रकार से नहीं पहुंच पाता। इसके long term में बहुत नुकसान होते हैं जैसे गठिया आदि बीमारियां।</p>
<p>अधिकतर समय AC में बिताने से पसीना नहीं आता जिससे शरीर के toxins बाहर नहीं निकल पाते और long term में इससे भी कई बीमारियों का खतरा बढ़ जाता है जैसे skin allergy or itching, high blood pressure आदि।</p>
<p>जब आप AC इतने कम तापमान पर चलाते हैं तो उसका कंप्रेसर लगातार फुल एनर्जी पर चलता है फिर चाहे वह 5 स्टार ही क्यों न हो, अत्यधिक बिजली फूंकता है और उसका पैसा आपकी जेब से जाता है।</p>
<p>इसमें क्या बुद्धिमानी है कि AC को पहले 20-21 पर चलाएं और फिर चादर ओढ़ लें। इससे बेहतर है कि AC को 25+ डिग्री पर चलाएं और पंखा भी चला लें।</p>
<p>इससे बिजली भी कम खर्च होगी और आपका शरीर का तापमान भी सीमा में रहेगा और उसे कोई नुकसान भी नहीं होगा।</p>
<p>इसका एक और फायदा है कि जब AC कम बिजली खर्च करेगा तो बिजलोघरों पर भी दवाब कम होगा औऱ अंततः global warming में भी कमी आएगी।</p>
<p>मान लीजिए AC को 26 पर चला कर आप लगभग 5 यूनिट बिजली प्रति AC प्रति रात्रि बचाते हैं और यदि ऐसा 10 लाख घरों में होता है तो आप 50 लाख यूनिट बिजली प्रतिदिन बचाते हैं।</p>
<p>कृपया विचार करें और अपने AC को 25 डिग्री से नीचे बिल्कुल न चलाएं। अपने शरीर और वातावरण को स्वस्थ रखें।</p>

<p><img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f42e.png" alt="🐮" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> *मांस का मूल्य*<img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f4b0.png" alt="💰" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>मगध सम्राट बिंन्दुसार ने एक बार अपनी सभा मे पूछा :<br />
देश की खाद्य समस्या को सुलझाने के लिए *सबसे सस्ती वस्तु क्या है ?*<br />
मंत्री परिषद् तथा अन्य सदस्य सोच में पड़ गये ! चावल, गेहूं, ज्वार, बाजरा आदि तो बहुत श्रम के बाद मिलते हैं और वह भी तब, जब प्रकृति का प्रकोप न हो, ऎसी हालत में अन्न तो सस्ता हो ही नहीं सकता !</p>
<p>तब शिकार का शौक पालने वाले एक सामंत ने कहा :<br />
राजन, *सबसे सस्ता खाद्य पदार्थ मांस है,* इसे पाने मे मेहनत कम लगती है और पौष्टिक वस्तु खाने को मिल जाती है । सभी ने इस बात का समर्थन किया, लेकिन प्रधान मंत्री चाणक्य चुप थे ।<br />
तब सम्राट ने उनसे पूछा : आपका इस बारे में क्या मत है ? चाणक्य ने कहा : मैं अपने विचार कल आपके समक्ष रखूंगा !</p>
<p>रात होने पर प्रधानमंत्री उस सामंत के महल पहुंचे, सामन्त ने द्वार खोला, इतनी रात गये प्रधानमंत्री को देखकर घबरा गया ।</p>
<p>प्रधानमंत्री ने कहा : शाम को महाराज एकाएक बीमार हो गये हैं, राजवैद्य ने कहा है कि किसी बड़े आदमी के हृदय का दो तोला मांस मिल जाए तो राजा के प्राण बच सकते हैं, इसलिए मैं आपके पास आपके हृदय <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f493.png" alt="💓" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> का सिर्फ दो तोला मांस लेने आया हूं । इसके लिए आप एक लाख स्वर्ण मुद्रायें ले लें ।</p>
<p>यह सुनते ही सामंत के चेहरे का रंग उड़ गया, उसने प्रधानमंत्री के पैर पकड़ कर माफी मांगी और *उल्टे एक लाख स्वर्ण मुद्रायें देकर कहा कि इस धन से वह किसी और सामन्त के हृदय का मांस खरीद लें ।*<br />
प्रधानमंत्री बारी-बारी सभी सामंतों, सेनाधिकारियों के यहां पहुंचे और *सभी से उनके हृदय का दो तोला मांस मांगा, लेकिन कोई भी राजी न हुआ, उल्टे सभी ने अपने बचाव के लिये प्रधानमंत्री को एक लाख, दो लाख, पांच लाख तक स्वर्ण मुद्रायें दीं ।*</p>
<p>इस प्रकार करीब दो करोड़ स्वर्ण मुद्राओं का संग्रह कर प्रधानमंत्री सवेरा होने से पहले वापस अपने महल पहुंचे और समय पर राजसभा में प्रधानमंत्री ने राजा के समक्ष दो करोड़ स्वर्ण मुद्रायें रख दीं ।</p>
<p>सम्राट ने पूछा : यह सब क्या है ? तब प्रधानमंत्री ने बताया कि दो तोला मांस खरिदने के लिए *इतनी धनराशि इकट्ठी हो गई फिर भी दो तोला मांस नही मिला ।* राजन ! अब आप स्वयं विचार करें कि मांस कितना सस्ता है ?</p>
<p>जीवन अमूल्य है, हम यह न भूलें कि जिस तरह हमें अपनी जान प्यारी है, उसी तरह सभी जीवों को भी अपनी जान उतनी ही प्यारी है । किंतु अंतर बस इतना है कि मनुष्य अपने प्राण बचाने हेतु हर सम्भव प्रयास कर सकता है । बोलकर, रिझाकर, डराकर, रिश्वत देकर आदि आदि । *पशु न तो बोल सकते हैं, न ही अपनी व्यथा बता सकते हैं । तो क्या बस इसी कारण उनस जीने का अधिकार छीन लिया जाय ।*</p>
<p>*शुद्ध आहार, शाकाहार !*<br />
*मानव आहार, शाकाहार !*<br />
